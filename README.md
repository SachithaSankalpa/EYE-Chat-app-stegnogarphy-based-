# EYE-Chat-app-stegnogarphy-based-
Final Year Project. 

In today’s world, information security has become a very important part of our lives. 
Steganography technology is widely used to protect and hide information. Steganography is the 
specialty of concealing data inside other data so that it is hard or even difficult to distinguish the 
presence of any concealed data. Currently, steganography technology is used in a variety of ways, 
with the most important of which is the hiding of data in an image.
In this project a Secret Chat app named “Eye Chat” is developed which presents a novel 
steganographic approach for secret messages between two private gatherings. The methodology 
presented in this undertaking makes utilization of both steganographic just as cryptographic 
procedures. 
For someone to send a messaging the Eye chat app, first that person needs to log in. To verify it’s 
the same person logging to the account, an OTP code (one-time password) is sent to his/her number 
provided and also a special security is applied to this. During this process, a security code is sent 
to the same number provided when registering to the account. This allows only the specific user 
to access to the account. Even if a third party enters the same contact number, they cannot have 
access to the account because the OTP will only be sent to the sim containing the relevant number. 
Thereafter, the user can select the recipient to send the message. 
After typing the message to be send, the sender must select an image. This image must certainly 
be in (.png) PNG format. After the secret code is entered, the secret message and secret code will 
start to encode. Here, the data entered by the user will be hidden by the pixels in the image. 
Later when the recipient receives the image, he can use the secret code to decrypt the message and 
the data (text) entered by the user will be shown. The specialty in this is that a third party will not 
see any difference in these images. It will be shown just like a normal image.
A special feature in this project is that the message will automatically get deleted in a determined 
time period after the recipient reads the message. 
Here, no third party will have the ability to read the message even in a case if the secret code is 
discovered.

Problem Identification -
Lifestyles of people has been changed due to the rapid advancement and evolving technological 
development the interpersonal relationship that existed in the post are now lost. As a result, today 
the confidential information and trusted messages are circulating through online performance. It 
had also made it easier for people to exchange information through messaging because of today’s 
busy lifestyles.
The best example for this is the Covid – 19 epidemic that has been going on for more than a year 
now. During a time like this, people isolate and live separately from each other. In these times 
they use different apps to exchange messages with each other. Although they use several app for 
convenience, they are not aware of the risks and insecurities involved when exchanging 
messages.
Even though the younger generation has some understanding about the security, the old 
generation still uses the old methods of exchanging their secret messages with each other. Due to 
this, a lot of times is wasted and also there is a possibility of a third party being able to access the 
messages sent.
Another problem is that in a conversation between two people in a traditional chat app, the are 
always in order unless the user deletes it. Because of this, always in a traditional chat app a third 
party has the ability to view an old chat box.
